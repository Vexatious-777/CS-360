# CS-360

The requirements and goals of the application I developed was to assist someone with keeping track of an inventory of items.
This was to be done in a grid-based user interface, that also used a user log-in page and SMS support to alert the user when their
stock was getting low.

The screens and features that were necessary to support user needs to me seemed to be a recycler view for the inventory to enable it to stay one page that would
be scrollabe for all items. Connection to SQLite that way user accounts and the items within the app would stay consistent and accurate after app shutdown.
My UI was user centered by being intuitive and simple that way a user just by interacting with the app should have no problems using it and I believe they were succesful.

I approached the process of coding my app by taking it step-by-step through incremental builds and then testing each piece to ensure they worked as intended. A strategy I plan
on continuing to implement.

I did test to ensure my code was functional by running it through the Android studio emulator. This process is important not only to make sure that the code works but to also
see what experience I am providing to the end user and how I might be able to improve the application in the future.

I had to innovate at one point during the entire process, when I had to implement SQLite to ensure that the application would correctly save data. Prior to this it would only
hold the data during runtime. This required rewriting of good portions of the inventory systems logic.

I believe the specific component that I was particularly succesful in demonstrating my abilites would have to be the implementation of SQLite.
